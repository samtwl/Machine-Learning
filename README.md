# Machine-Learning
In this repository, you can find several Machine Learning Projects that I have undertaken. Each project uses a different dataset and focuses on a different machine learning topic. Projects that are of a smaller scale are located under the folder "Small-scale Projects" while projects of a larger scale are located under the folder "Large-scale Projects".

Small-scale projects are projects with implementation of one or two types of models, with emphasis on the exploration and study of each model type. On the other hand, large-scale projects are projects that explores a wider range of machine learning topics, covering more than three types of models. For more information of each small-scale and large-scale project, please refer to their respective readme file in their corresponding folder.

The following table indicates the corresponding machine learning topic to each dataset used:

## For Small-scale Machine Learning Projects
| Dataset | Machine Learning Topic |
| --- | --- |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bike Sharing Dataset | Regularized Linear Regression |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Seeds Dataset | Logistic Regression |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail Dataset | Topic Modelling |
| Microchip Quality Assurance Dataset | Gaussian Naive Bayes & Multi-class Classification |

## For Large-scale Machine Learning Projects
| Dataset | Machine Learning Topic |
| --- | --- |
| Various Datasets for Apartments, Condominiums and Executive-Condominiums in Singapore | Multivariable Linear Regression; Regression Tree (Decision Tree); Ensemble Trees (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor & Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor) |
