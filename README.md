# Machine-Learning
In this repository, you can find several Machine Learning Projects that I have undertaken. Each project uses a different dataset and focuses on a different machine learning topic.

The following table indicates the corresponding machine learning topic to each dataset used:

| Dataset | Machine Learning Topic |
| --- | --- |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bike Sharing Dataset | Regularized Linear Regression |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Seeds Dataset | Logistic Regression |
| UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail Dataset | Topic Modelling |
| Microchip Quality Assurance Dataset | Gaussian Naive Bayes & Multi-class Classification |
